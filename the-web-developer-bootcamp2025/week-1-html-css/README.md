what I learned

1. what HTML5 actually is
   HTML5 is the latest version of HyperText Markup Language, providing improved support for multimedia, graphics, and responsive design while ensuring better performance and accessibility for modern web applications.

2. Block Vs. Inline Elements

3. <span> and <div> elements
<div> is like a generic container that can contains content and group elements together.
<Span> works for inline elements, style them independently, a piece of tag

4. Semantic Elements
   html elements naming by waht they mean. it help coder understand the meaning of the element rather than just the generic container<span> <div>. doesn't has any meaning, doesn't explain about what it contains.

   4.1 help SEO, the browser can find it.
   4.2 screen readers
   4.3 help you and others more easier navigate to the code, make the element obvious

   `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`, `<h1>` to `<h6>`, `<p>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`
