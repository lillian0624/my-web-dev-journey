# Web Development Learning Journey

Welcome to my Web Development learning journey! This repository tracks my progress as I work through two highly recommended courses: 

1. **The Web Developer Bootcamp 2025** by Colt Steele
2. **Modern React with Redux [2024 Update]** by Stephen Grider

The goal of this project is to learn full-stack web development, focusing on both the front-end and back-end. I'll build projects, learn key concepts, and apply them to real-world applications.

## Progress Overview

Iâ€™m starting with foundational web development skills (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and will eventually move into more advanced technologies like React and Redux. This repository will contain code, notes, and project files for each course.

## Goals

- **Complete both courses**: The Web Developer Bootcamp and Modern React with Redux.
- **Build and deploy real-world projects**: Apply skills to build interactive web applications and back-end services.
- **Create a strong portfolio**: Showcase all completed projects to demonstrate my skills and knowledge to future employers.
- **Improve problem-solving**: Gain hands-on experience solving coding challenges and building real-world applications.
